    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      By comparing expected goals to actual performance, users can see which soccer teams are deviating from their
      expected performance. This project aims to compile data related to the English Premier League and create
      visualizations to represent performance at the team and individual player level. These visualizations will be
      useful to bring attention to undervalued players, as well as to teams that are beating expectations. The
      information gained from the visualizations can be used by scouts, bettors or casual fans to gain a deeper insight
      into the performance of teams and players. <br>

    <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
    <p>
      The visualization tool's intended use is to discover insights into the performance of teams and players in the
      English Premier League. One way to do this is by looking at overall underlying performance and seeing which teams
      are performing well in these metrics. By then comparing looking at actual performance, it is possible to check
      whether this underlying performance is translating to results. This same process can be performed for players,
      which is a great way to find potential hidden gems. <br>
